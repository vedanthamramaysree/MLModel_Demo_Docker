This repository includes code containerize and deploy the Huggingface model-BART, used for summarization of text. 

BART:

BART, which pre-trains a model combining Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers. BART is a denoising autoencoder built with a sequence-to-sequence model that applies to a very wide range of end tasks. In this repository, we used BART for the summarization of large texts into a few lines. 

Why Summarizing is necessary for data science?

The term Data Summarization refers to presenting the summary of generated data in an easily comprehensible and informative manner. Data summarization is the first step in statistics, it is aimed at extracting useful information and general trends from the raw data.

In this repository, I have used an article written by me in medium to summarize and get a gist of it. The purpose of using this hugging face model for summarizing is to make my non-data science teams and functional experts understand what's in the technical writing, before reading it in prior. Practically, text summarization saves a lot of time and effort.

Huggingface_model_notebook.ipynb: In this experiment, the BART model is set to summarize text to a maximum of 150 words. It is a python notebook demonstrating the model inputs and results for reference.
